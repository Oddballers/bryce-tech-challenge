# Audio Files

Place your audio files here:

- `theme.mp3` - Main background theme (MP3 format)
- `theme.ogg` - Main background theme (OGG format for better browser compatibility)

## Supported Formats

The audio player supports:
- MP3 (most widely supported)
- OGG (open source format)
- WAV (uncompressed, larger file size)

## Recommendations

- Keep file sizes reasonable (under 5MB for background audio)
- Consider using ambient/instrumental music that won't distract from the interface
- Test volume levels - the default is set to 70%
- Ensure audio loops smoothly if intended for continuous playback
